 No answer comes. Another letter
 he sends, a second, then a third.
 No answer comes. He goes, for better
 or worse, to a soir&eacute;e. Unheard
 she appears before him, grim and frozen.
 No look, no word for him: she's chosen
 to encase herself inside a layer
 of Twelfth Night's chillest, iciest air.
 To batten down their indignation
 is all those stubborn lips desire!
 Onegin looks with eyes of fire:
 where are distress, commiseration?
 No tearstains, nothing. Wrath alone
 is graven on that face of stone.
